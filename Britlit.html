       Student 1: This course is focused on literature that is not too recent. The language is rather tough to understand, so it takes quite a while to understand the material that is being 
      read or analyzed. Pay attention in class, and complete all the work during the class period. Ask the teachers for guidance, and pointers if you feel confused about certain passages etc. If 
      the work is completed in class, there is not too much outside of class work.
