       Student 1: This is a nicely paced class, and it focuses on making sure each and every topic is covered in a way which ensures conceptual understanding. Take notes in class if you are finding 
      the topics confusing. Tests are rather frequent, but focusing in class, and completing the few homework assignments should prepare you well. Pay attention in class, and complete assignments, and 
      there shouldn't be too much outside work. 
    </p>

      Course Information: Recommended: Biology and Algebra 1. Physics is a laboratory course based on the Next Generation
Science Standards. Students will explore and deepen their understanding of the universe and humansâ€™
relationships with the Earth through the lens of physics, which includes the following core ideas:
energy, matter, forces, time, and space. Students will continue to grow in their ability to learn, to think,
and to act like scientists, preparing them to make informed decisions about important science-related
issues in our society and the world. Emphasis is placed on conceptual, rather than the mathematical,
understanding to explain natural phenomena.
