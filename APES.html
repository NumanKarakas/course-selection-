Student 1: This is considered as one of the easier AP courses by a lot of the students. Similar to most other courses, make sure to pay attention in class, and complete the homework assignments. 
      The tests are rather infrequent, so most of the outside of class work comes from the homework. Make sure to think above the obvious, and make the deeper connections while completing the homework, 
      and submit all the assignments on time, try not to have any late work, as it does affect your grade.

Course Information: Recommended: Biology, Chemistry or Physics, and Algebra 2 (can be concurrent). This class is
equivalent to an introductory college-level environmental science class. Students study scientific
principles, systems, and explore how humans interact with and depend on their environment. In this
interdisciplinary, problem-based, “big-picture” science course, students apply elements of many
traditional lab sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics) and social sciences
(economics, history, government). Contemporary environmental issues such as climate change,
pollution, population dynamics, food and land resources, energy consumption, urban planning, and
species loss will be explored in great depth. This class is well suited for students who have a strong
interest and commitment to better understanding their environment and who enjoy connecting science
to social and political issues.
