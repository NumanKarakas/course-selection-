       Student 1: There is a lot of memorization required in this course, but not too much outside of class work. Make sure to study well for the tests, and know your vocabulary, as it comes 
      extremely handy in understanding the concepts, and for the tests.

      Course Information: Recommended: Biology and Chemistry. This is a laboratory course investigating the functional and
interdependent phenomena of the human body, its systems, and the maintenance of homeostasis.
Studies include anatomical structure and physiological function for the development, performance, and
coordination of internal and external activities of the human body. Dissections, observations of organs,
and practice with models serve as an anchor for understanding these human systems.
