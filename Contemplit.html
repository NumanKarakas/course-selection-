Student 1: This course is very similar to American Literature Honors. There is a focus on contemporary topics, and there is a lot of film analysis involved, during the second part of the year. Though there is 
      a good amount of work done during the class period, there is also a decent amount of outside of class workload, which is mainly just reading, and reading analysis, and occasionally writing your own 
      thoughts and opinions about contemporary issues from today's soceity.

Course Description: This course enables students to read and analyze literature relevant to ideas and problems of people
today. Themes central to the human situation are discussed and debated, and students write expository
essays. This course also delves into contemporary thought and applies those values to the literature
through formal papers, discussions and projects.
