Student 1: This course focuses on a lot of contemporary topics, and social issues of the modern day soceity. There is definitely a decent amount of writing involved, but your contribution in class is extremely 
      crucial for your grade. Participate actively, and share your thoughts in discussions, or whenever asked by the teacher. 3 books are read/covered and analyzed in the entire span of the course, so there is also
      a good amount of reading involved as well.

Course Description: This course is designed for students who enjoy being challenged in literature and writing classes and
who are prepared to accept the responsibilities of that challenge. Like the American Literature course
this honors course is a chronological or thematic study of American literature, its literary periods and
its major writers; however, the honors course will include more extensive reading, writing (both timed
and process essays) and analytical thinking. Furthermore, students in the honors program are expected
to invest significantly more academic energy into the course and to work more independently than
students taking American Literature and Writing.
