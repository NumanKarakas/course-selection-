Student 1: Pre-calculus skills need to be very strong in order to have sucess in this course. There is a decent amount of workload, and studying for tests. 
      Doing the homework will really help prepare for the tests, and make sure to stay focused during class.

Course Information: : Sucessful completion of Pre-Calculus is strong reccomended for AP Calculus AB. This course covers the content of two quarters (more than
one semester) of a college Calculus curriculum, focusing on the application of limits, differentiation and
integration. Some techniques of integration and indeterminate forms for limits are also covered.
Throughout the course, an emphasis is placed on symbolic, graphical, and numeric representations, as
well as on clear communication of mathematical thinking. Successful completion of this course
prepares students to take the Ap Calculus AB  Exam. Completion of this course with a grade of “C” or higher will clear a CSU Early Assessment Program result of
“Conditionally Ready” on the 11th grade Smarter Balanced assessment.
