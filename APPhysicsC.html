    Strategies for Success from fellow Matadors

    <p class = "Stud1">
       Student 1: This is a pretty intense course, and requires solid understanding of APPhysics 1. Make sure to take notes during the class, and listen to the teacher and the explanation
      of concepts during class. Asking the teacher for explanations of topics that are not understood is extremely key for sucess in this class. Make sure to actively study for the tests, even 
      though there are retakes offered, because similar to Physics 1, they are a major part of the grade. Also, be prepared to expect a decent amount of outside of class workload, 
      homework, but mainly studying for tests. 
    </p>

Course Information: Sucessful completion of AP Calculus BC and AP Physics 1 are strongly recommended for this course. AP Physics C aligns with a two-semester,
calculus-based, college physics course sequence for science or engineering majors and covers the
content of both AP Physics C: Mechanics and AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. Students will
deepen their understanding of physics topics such as motion, forces, momentum, energy, fields,
circuits, and electromagnetism. Emphasis is placed on laboratory experimentation, problem solving,
and quantitative understanding of physics.  </p>
