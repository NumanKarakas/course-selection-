      Student 1: This course requires a lot of reading, and making connections with broader topics. There is both memorization of facts, and events as well as being able to connect topics at a broader level. 
      This course brings a lot of homework daily, and it is a rather time-consuming course. Remeber to think about your after-school schedule to make sure you can accomodate the workload from this course, before signing up for it!

Course Description: Recommended: Students should have earned a “B” or better in their previous history class and have
strong writing skills. This survey course gives students a thorough grounding in facts, and goes on to
examine the significance of facts, their contexts, as well as their causes and results. This course is
designed to provide students with the analytic skills and factual knowledge necessary to deal critically
with the problems and material in United States history. Students learn how to read historical material
analytically and critically, to weigh historical evidence and interpretations and to arrive at conclusions
based on facts. Students should expect a steady and heavy load of reading from the textbook, in
addition to Document Based and Free Response essays that put particular demands on historical
knowledge and the ability to make and prove a historical argument. Unlike the mainstream US History
course, where there is single focus on the US in the 20th Century, AP US History covers the entire scope
of our history, from the Amerindian settlements to contemporary American issues. The course makes
demands similar to those found in introductory college courses and prepares students for success on
the AP US History test held in early May.
