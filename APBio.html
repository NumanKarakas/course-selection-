Student 1: This is a very fast-paced course, and there is a lot of memorization involved. In addition to regular homework assignments, there is a prep or studying that is very important before the tests. 
      Make sure to stay on track, and keep reviewing previous topics, and make sure to understand everything while it's being taught instead of pushing it off for later. Ask the teachers any questions, and they 
      will give you the proper guidance and help.

      Course Information: Sucessful completion of Chemistry and Biology are highly recommended prior to taking this course. AP Biology is the equivalent of a two-semester college
introductory biology course that is based on eight units including: Chemistry of Life, Cell Structure and
Function, Cellular Energetics, Cell Communication and Cell Cycle, Heredity, Gene Expression and
Regulation, Natural Selection, and Ecology. While delving deeply into these foundational biology
concepts, students will develop their inquiry and reasoning skills by designing experiments, analyzing
data, and justifying arguments using evidence.
