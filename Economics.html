Student 1: Make sure to stay focused in class, and listen during class, and participate actively during the class discussions. Make sure to get  all the concepts, or else ask the teacher. Take notes in class, and use them to study for the tests. Tests are 
      rather infrequent in the class. If all the work is completed during the class time, then there is basically no homework.
