Student 1: This course requires extremely strong Algebra 2 skills, and is relatively easier if previous topics are mastered. The workload is equally 
      balanced between the homework and studying for tests, but the practice tests are extremely useful to study for the tests. Use the completed homework assignments to 
      help study for the test in addition to the practice tests. Use the textbook if you need clarification, or make sure to ask the teacher for help.

Course Information: : Successful completion of Algebra 2/2-Trigonometry is strongly reommended for this course. This course focuses on the
study of families of functions, their application in mathematical modeling, and the use of equivalence to
rewrite expressions to reveal important features. Students analyze features of a variety of functions
and their graphs, connect different representations, and identify and apply transformations of
equations and graphs. To solve problems using function models, students choose among function
families, fit linear and nonlinear functions to data, and interpret, apply, and evaluate the resulting
models. The study of functions in this course includes strengthening of concepts and skills from prior
courses, fuller development of equivalent forms of functions, and an in-depth study of trigonometry
and its applications. Completion of this course with a grade of “C” or higher will clear a CSU Early
Assessment Program result of “Conditionally Ready” on the 11th grade Smarter Balanced assessment.
Full mastery of concepts and skills from this course prepares students for AP Calculus AB.
