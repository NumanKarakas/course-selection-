Student 1: This course required strong skills from Pre-Calculus Honors. There is a lot of work from this class, in terms of homework, and studying for tests, and 
      preparing and reviewing past material, but all of this is very helpful fo the AP test in the spring. Stay focused in class, don't get behind, and ask any 
      clarifying questions when necessary.

Course Information: : Mastery of Pre-Calculus Honors is strongly recommended for AP Calculus BC. This course covers the content of three quarters (two
semesters) of a college Calculus curriculum, focusing on applications of limits, differentiation and
integration. Numerical approaches (such as Newton’s method, Simpson’s Rule, and Euler’s Method);
various techniques of integration; indeterminate forms for limits; and Taylor series are also covered, as
well as application of Calculus techniques to parametric and polar representations. Throughout the
course, an emphasis is placed on symbolic, graphical and numeric representations, as well as on clear
communication of mathematical thinking. Successfully completion of this course prepares students 
to take the AP Calculus BC  Exam. Completion of this course with a grade of “C” or higher will clear a CSU Early Assessment Program result of “Conditionally Ready”
on the 11th grade Smarter Balanced assessment.
