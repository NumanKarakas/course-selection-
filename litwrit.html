      Student 1: Pay attention during class, and complete the assignments that are given. There is a good amount of reading homework, and it is extremely helpful to actually read the books, instead of 
      using summaries, or other websites online. Mainly the homework is just reading, and answering reading questions, but occasionally there are writing assignments. 
      The homework/classwork that is given is very intentional, and helps out with assignments that are given in the future. Make sure to take time with your writing assignments, accuracy assignments, and essays, 
      as they are weighted quite a bit and are graded in a rather tough way.
