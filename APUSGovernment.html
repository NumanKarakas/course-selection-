       Student 1: Pay attention in class, ask teachers any questions when they come up. Study with a group of people, quiz yourself, as it is a rather fast paced class, and it is hard to keep up with all 
      the material that is covered. Take notes, and use them as a resource to prepare for the test, but don't use the notes as the ONLY resource.

Course Description: Recommended: Students should have earned a “B” or better in their previous history class and have
strong writing skills. The advanced placement course in government parallels an introductory college
course in political science. The course is designed to give students a thorough understanding of and
critical perspective on the system of US government politics, policy, and practices. Instruction
emphasizes understanding course content by way of in-depth research and analysis. Furthermore,
students will apply their understanding of the subject matter to both historical and current political
events and analyze their impact on American society. AP US Government and Politics is a tightly
structured, highly demanding, fast-paced college-level course in which students study a year’s amount
of curriculum in only one semester. Students will be required to read the college-level textbook and
supplemental readings. Expository writing will be required. Ideally, this course is really for those
students who are specifically interested in government and politics.
