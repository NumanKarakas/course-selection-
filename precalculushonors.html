Student 1: This is a rather fast paced class, but your Algebra 2/Trig skills/knowledge come extremely handy. The tests are frequent so make sure to understand 
      all the previous topics before taking the test and moving on. Practice is extremely important as the tests are always a time crunch, so make sure to practice 
      in a timed setting, as it helps gain speed and mastery. The topics covered are quite similar to Pre-calculus, but they are covered in further depth.

Course Information: Mastery of both Geometry and Algebra 2/Trigonometry are strongly recommended for this course. 
PreCalculus Honors is a fast-paced course which assumes that students have already mastered all skills and concepts
from prior courses. The focus is on expanding the study of functions to a broad variety of function
types, with increased emphasis on abstract thinking and formal proofs. Students analyze features of a
variety of functions and their graphs, connect different representations, and identify and apply
transformations of equations and graphs. Students also solve challenging problems using function
models, where they choose among function families, fit linear and nonlinear functions to data, and
interpret, apply, and evaluate the resulting models. This course continues the rigorous study of
trigonometry begun in Algebra 2/Trigonometry, moving on to advanced equations, graphs, and proofs,
including the study of vectors and polar coordinates. Students also continue their study of topics such
as the algebra of polynomials and rationals, advanced inequalities, conic sections, and sequences and
series. Completion of this course with a grade of “C” or higher will clear a CSU Early Assessment
Program result of “Conditionally Ready” on the 11th grade Smarter Balanced assessment. Successful
completion of this course prepares students to take AP Calculus AB. Full mastery of concepts and
skill from this course prepares student for AP Calculus BC.
