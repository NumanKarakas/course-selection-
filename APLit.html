Student 1: This course requires a lot of work and thinking. It incorporates a lot of writing which takes a while after school as well. This 
      course really helps while submitting college applications, as it gives really good essay writing practice.

Course Description: This Advanced Placement English course in Literature and Composition engages students in the careful
reading and critical analysis of literature. Through the close reading of selected texts, students deepen
their understanding of the ways writers use language to provide both meaning and pleasure for their
readers. As they read, students consider a work’s structure, style and themes, as well as smaller-scale
elements, such as the use of figurative language, imagery, symbolism and tone. The course includes
intensive study of representative works from various genres and periods, concentrating on selections
that do not yield all of their pleasures of thought and feeling the first time through. Students will read
deliberately and thoroughly, taking time to understand a work’s complexity in order to absorb its
richness of meaning and to analyze how that meaning is embodied in literary form. Completion of this
course with a grade of “C” or higher will clear a CSU Early Assessment Program result of “Conditionally
Ready” on the 11th grade Smarter Balanced assessment.
