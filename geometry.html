Student 1: This course requires some of the Algebra 1 material. Make sure to not fall behind on any of the concepts, as they build on each other, and it is very hard to catch up later on. Make sure to complete
      all the homeowork assignments, participate in class, and study for the tests. 
    </p>

Course Information: Sucessful completion of Algebra 1 is strongly reccomended for this course. The Geometry course focuses on a formal development of geometric skills and concepts.
Students build their visualization, reasoning, and mathematical communication skills through study of
the following topics: transformations, congruence, similarity, properties of geometric shapes
(triangles, quadrilaterals, circles), geometric modeling (plane and solid), coordinate geometry, and
right triangle trigonometry. They also develop the ability to construct formal logical arguments and
proofs in a geometric setting. Completion of Geometry in addition with Algebra 1 prepares students for Algebra 2.
