       Student 1: This course is more relaxed than American Lit Honors, but there is still a decent amount of work outside of class, which is mainly consisting of reading and analyzing the reading. Make sure 
      to finish all the classwork during the class period, as it eliminates a good portion of the homework. Ask the teacher for help if you are having difficulties understanding the meaning of certain readings, or texts, 
      as they can point you in the right direction.

Course Description: This course provides rigorous and challenging experiences for the student in the areas of critical
reading, critical thinking, effective discussion, essay test-taking, expository writing and research. The
core of the curriculum is a chronological or thematic study of American literature, its literary periods
and major writings. Outside reading focuses on broader philosophical ideas, encouraging wider reading
including classics by American authors.
