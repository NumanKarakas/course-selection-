      Student 1: There is a lot of memorization, and active studying involved for this class. Study with a group of people, and ask your friends for help if 
      you don't understand something. The textbook and some online resources will be your best friend while completing homework and studying for tests. There is 
      very few homework assignments in this class, but the occasional ones that are assigned take quite a long time. The main workload from this class is extremely frequent
      quizzes/tests. Spend far more time studying for the unit tests, as the are more challenging and weigh more compared to the quizzes. Make sure to understand all the 
      topics right when they are taught, because once you fall behind, it is hard to catch up and learn the next topics, as this is a course where the material covered 
      builds upon previously taught material.

      Course Information: Recommended: Biology and Geometry (can be concurrent). Chemistry Honors is a laboratory course
based on the Next Generation Science Standards. Students will explore and deepen their understanding
of Earth’s systems and humans’ relationships with the Earth through the lens of chemistry, which
includes the following core ideas: structures and properties of matter, chemical reactions, and the
energy and forces that drive these interactions. Students will continue to grow in their ability to learn,
to think and to act like scientists, preparing them to make informed decisions about important sciencerelated issues in our society and the world. The honors course incorporates an increased application of
mathematical reasoning to explain chemical phenomena, a rigorous application of the concepts, and
more intensive pacing.
