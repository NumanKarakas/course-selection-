Course Information: The key content in this course involves understanding, writing, solving, and graphing linear, exponential, and quadratic
equations and inequalities. Solving systems of two linear equations in two unknowns is also emphasized. Exponential
relationships are studied in comparison with linear relationships to highlight the characteristics of
exponential growth and decay. Quadratic equations are solved by factoring, using graphs, and applying
the quadratic formula. Students should also become comfortable with operations on monomial and
polynomial expressions. Students learn to solve problems by employing all of these techniques. 
Algebra 1 is imperative for success in subsequent math courses, and sucessful completion of Algebra 1 prepares students for Geometry.  </p>
