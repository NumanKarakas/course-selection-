      Student 1: This class is very similar to the literature class from freshman year. There is significantly less homework, but the projects and accuracy assignments make up a lot of your grade. This course
      is very different for different students, and is based on the teacher that you have, as all the teachers have very unique teaching material, so there is not a single set of recommendations. 
    </p>
  
    <p class = "FurtherInfo"> 
Course Description: Using works of world literature, the student will explore themes of human experience and inquiry. The
literature will include novels, plays, stories and poetry by historical and contemporary authors from
around the world. This literature-based program provides instruction and experiences for students to
build their listening, speaking, reading, writing and thinking skills.
