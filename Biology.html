Student 1: Pay close attention in class, as it is a rather fast paced course, compared to middle school science courses. Ask the teachers any questions that you may have, 
      as it is better to have the concepts solidified before taking the test. The homework that is assigned becomes easier as you pay attention in class, and ask claryfying questions. 
      Studying with a friend, or a buddy as there are a lot of things to remember in general.

  Course Information: Biology is an introductory laboratory course based on the Next Generation Science Standards that
includes the following core ideas: From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes;
Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics; Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits; and
Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity. Students will explore and deepen their understanding of
these core ideas through scientific inquiry. In the process, they will learn to think and act like scientists
by using science practices and cross-cutting concepts that they can apply in subsequent science
courses. As part of the California Healthy Youth Act, students will engage in a comprehensive sexual
health education unit that will prepare them to make informed and healthy choices.
