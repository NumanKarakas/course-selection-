Student 1: This course helps tremendously for pre-calculus honors. It is a fast paced course, compared to Algebra 2, and understanding the concepts is crucial for your math foundation. There is a good amount of 
      homework, but studying for tests is extremely important, and is the main part of the workload. Make sure to do your homework neatly, and use all the resources that are offered by the teacher to study and prepare for the tests.

Course Information: Mastery of Algebra 1 and Geometry is strongly recommended. Algebra 2/Trigonometry
includes a more rigorous study of all topics taught in the Algebra 2 course. As in Algebra 2, emphasis is
placed on abstract thinking skills, the function concept, extension of right triangle trigonometry to the
unit circle and domain of all real numbers, and the algebraic solution of problems in various content
areas. Polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, radical, rational, and trigonometric functions comprise the
core material through which equations, graphs, and their transformations are studied and applied. The
course also includes an introduction to statistics and sequences and series. Beyond the content of
Algebra 2, students learn trigonometry in depth. All 6 trigonometric functions as they relate to the unit 
circle using radians and degrees, including simplifying expressions, solving equations, graphing, and applications 
are covered in this course. Additional topics include solving triangles, defining and solving equations with inverse 
trigonometric functions, and proving and applying trigonometric identities. Calculators are used to aid in the solution 
of problems and in making estimates for realistic solutions. Successful completion of Algebra 2/Trigonometry prepares 
students for Pre-Calculus or Applications of Advanced Mathematics. Mastery of Algebra 2/Trigonometry
prepares students for Pre-Calculus Honors.
