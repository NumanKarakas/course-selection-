Student 1: Relatively comfortably paced class compared to Chemistry Honors. This course allows students to take their time with understanding the concepts. Small 
      amounts of homework is assigned in this class, but since tests are rather frequent, studying and reviewing material for the tests is the mainworkload.

      Course Information: Recommended: Biology and Algebra 1 (can be concurrent). Chemistry is a laboratory course based on
the Next Generation Science Standards. Students will explore and deepen their understanding of
Earth’s systems and humans’ relationships with the Earth through the lens of chemistry, which include
the following core ideas: structures and properties of matter, chemical reactions, and the energy and
forces that drive these interactions. Students will continue to grow in their ability to learn, to think, and
to act like scientists, preparing them to make informed decisions about important science-related
issues in our society and the world. Emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding of ideas, and
students are expected to use algebra to explain these ideas.
