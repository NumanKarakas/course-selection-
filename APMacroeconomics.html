Student 1: Make sure to take notes in this class while the teacher is talking. Understanding the basics is extremely important at the beginning of the course, because all the topics spiral back 
      to the fundamentals. Use all the resources that are availble, like online videos, and the textbook. Most of the work happens during the class, so make sure to stay on task in class, and there is barely 
      any other outside of work class.

Course Description: It is recommended that students should have earned a “B” or better in their previous history class and have
strong writing skills. The purpose of the Advanced Placement course in Economics is to give students a
thorough and advanced understanding of the principles of economics that apply to the functions of
individual decision makers, both consumers and producers, within the larger mixed market economic
system. It places primary emphasis on the nature and functions of decision making by households and
firms.
