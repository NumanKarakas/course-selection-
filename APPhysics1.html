       Student 1: Make sure to complete all the video lectures that are assigned, and take your own set of notes on them. Do not copy someone elses notes, as they lead to weak understanding 
      of the topics that will be very important for the tests. Though the tests are not frequent, make sure to study well for the tests, as they are worth a lot. Put a decent amount of time, and 
      effort into the labs, and the follow-up procedures, as they also play a big role in your grade.

Course Information: Completion of Algebra 2 and Biology are recommended for this course. AP Physics 1 is based on the “big ideas” in physics, and is the
equivalent of the first semester of college-level, algebra-based physics. Students will cultivate their
understanding of foundational physics concepts through inquiry-based investigations as they explore
topics including kinematics, dynamics, forces, circular motion, gravitation, work, energy, power,
rotational motion, mechanical waves, sound, electric force and simple circuits </p>
