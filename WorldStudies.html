Student 1: This is a very collaborative, and interesting class. If you like to work in groups of people, on projects or assignments, this course will be really fun for you. Pay attention in class, do your work
        during class, and there should be very minimal amounts of outside of class work.

Course Information:  World Studies is an integrated class, designed for sophomore students, which incorporates World
History and a foundation level English course into a two-period block class. World History from the
French Revolution to the present day is the context in which the class operates. It uses appropriate
literature from the major continents and civilizations of the world to integrate into the study of world
history. A major emphasis is placed on writing, including essays, term papers, and short theses. A
determined effort is made to ensure that diverse cultural perspectives are incorporated in all units of
study.
