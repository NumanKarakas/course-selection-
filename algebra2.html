Student 1: This course is very important for Pre-Calculus, and understanding ALL of the concepts makes pre-calculus far easier. Make sure to ask questions, nd complete your homework on time. Tests are everyday, 
      but are worth very small, and are weighted equally as homework, so as long as you are understanding the concepts, and completing the homework, this class shouldn't be too hard.

Course Information: Successful completion of Algebra 1 and Geometry are strongly recommended for this course. 
Algebra 2 expands and refines the mathematical content of Algebra 1 and Geometry. Emphasis is placed on abstract 
thinking skills, the function concept, extension of right triangle trigonometry to the unit circle and domain of all real
numbers, and the algebraic solution of problems in various content areas. Polynomial, exponential,
logarithmic, radical, rational, and trigonometric functions comprise the core material through which
equations, graphs, and their transformations are studied and applied. The course also includes an
introduction to statistics and sequences and series. Calculators are used to aid in the solution of
problems and in making estimates for realistic solutions. Successful completion of Algebra 2 prepares 
students for Precalculus or Applications of Advanced Mathematics.
