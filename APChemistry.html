      Student 1: This course builds off the topics that are covered in Chemistry Honors. There is a lot of focus on apllying all the memorization from Chemistry Honors, into labs, and abstract ideas, 
      so it is highly recommended to take this course right after completing Chemistry honors, and without skipping Chemistry Honors, or taking a gap year to complete another science course. There is a lot of 
      outside work, in addition to classwork, as the labs have to be perfectly noted, and the documentation techniques have to be perfect. Tests are also quite frequent, but homework assignments are rather rare.

Course Information: Sucessful completion of Chemistry Honors and Algebra 2 is strongly recommended. AP Chemistry is the equivalent of a two-semester
college introductory chemistry course. The course is organized around six big ideas that students will
come to understand: atomic structure, chemical and physical properties of matter, chemical reactions,
reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and chemical equilibrium. Emphasis is placed on laboratory
experimentation, problem solving and quantitative understanding of complex chemical phenomena.</p>
