Student 1: Pay attention during class, and take notes. Make sure to do "active studying" instead of just reading the textbook, or the notes. 
      Watch videos online(Heimlers history), to help understand the material, and take notes during the videos to help you understand the topics that will be on the test. There is a fair amount of 
      discussions and focus around current political topics. 
    </p>
  
    <p class = "FurtherInfo"> 
Course Decription: The goals of this course are to give an understanding of democratic processes and an awareness of the
